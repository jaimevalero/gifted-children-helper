**Objective:** To design a comprehensive and adaptive curriculum that enhances the student’s interest in geology and history through experiential learning, digital resources, and community engagement, while addressing identified academic performance metrics and learning gaps.

**Curriculum Plan:**

1. **Academic Performance Metrics and Learning Gaps:**
   - **Current Performance:** The student shows signs of disengagement in traditional classroom settings, likely impacting academic achievement negatively.
   - **Learning Gaps:** Requires advanced, varied content to stimulate interest and challenge high cognitive abilities in geology and history.

2. **Tailored Engagement Strategies:**

   **Geology:**
   - **Hands-On Experiments:**
     - **At-Home Kits:** Provide geology experiment kits with rock samples, minerals, and basic testing tools for practical investigations.
     - **Virtual Field Trips:** Utilize platforms like Google Earth VR or specialized apps (e.g., Earth Science Explorations) for immersive geological exploration experiences.
   - **Local Excursions:**
     - Organize supervised visits to geological sites, museums, and nature reserves to enhance practical learning experiences.

   **History:**
   - **Project-Based Learning:**
     - **Timeline Creation:** Encourage students to build detailed timelines of historical events, possibly focusing on familial histories for personal relevance.
     - **Role-Playing and Simulations:** Engage in historical role-plays and use simulation games to deepen understanding and interest.
   - **Digital Resources:**
     - Leverage interactive platforms such as the Smithsonian Learning Lab for virtual museum tours and educational documentaries tailored for advanced learners.
   - **Community Engagement:**
     - Facilitate visits to local historical sites and cultural institutions, participating in community events that highlight historical themes when feasible.

3. **Adaptive Learning Pathways:**
   - **Personalized Curriculum:** Develop a flexible curriculum offering advanced topics and interactive methodologies tailored to the student’s high cognitive abilities and specific interests in geology and history.
   - **Regular Monitoring:** Implement ongoing progress assessments and feedback mechanisms to dynamically adjust the learning plan based on engagement and understanding.
   - **Parental Involvement:** Engage parents in supporting these specialized activities at home to ensure continuity between educational environments, especially considering current arrangements with the abuela and mobility constraints.

**Summary:**
By focusing on hands-on experiments, immersive digital experiences, local field trips, project-based learning, and strong community and parental involvement, this curriculum aims to significantly enhance the student’s academic performance and engagement in geology and history, leveraging their unique strengths and interests effectively.
